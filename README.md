### RGngs Laumcher
This project was started with the intention of creating an easy way to download server content for a now-defunct gaming community. It's built using the Electron framework with a few additional packages. 

### Installation 
Since the Launcher was never oficially finished it's only possible to run it through the commandline. Simply dowload all packages using `npm install` and run it using `npm run start`.
